## What is a B Corporation?

A benefit corporation or B corporation is a corporate form designed for for-profit entities that wish to consider society and the environment in addition to profit in their decision making process.

B Corps are certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.

Today, there is a growing community of more than 1,000 Certified B Corps from 33 countries and over 60 industries working together toward 1 unifying goal: to redefine success in business.

## Mission

Con Moto is a data agency dedicated to having a positive impact on our community and environment while delivering exceptional client work.

### Guiding Principles

1. Donate 20% of our profits
1. Donate 20% of our time
1. Operate carbon-neutral
1. Measure our impact and operate with transparency
1. Empower others to have a positive impact

## 1. Charitable Giving

We donate 20% of our profits to charity with a particular emphasis on several key areas.

### Sustainable Agriculture

We get involved with Community Supported Agriculture as consumers and also with charitable giving. We are currently evaluating non-profits for donation in order to expand giving in this area.

### Education and Civic Literacy

We are currently evaluating non-profits for donation in order to expand giving in this area.

## 2. Volunteerism

Sometimes when you get busy, it is easier to write a check than to get involved with your own time. It is a core guiding principle to we contribute 20% of our work week — every work week — to improving the community by donating our time.

### Involvement in the Community

In 1998 I had the pleasure of founding a local chapter of Habitat for Humanity in Eden Prairie, MN, in coordination with the local high school. In our second year, both financial donations and volunteer hours exceeded the local National Honor Society.

I continue to appreciate the impact that H4H has on the local community, particularly their "sweat equity" principle that requires beneficiaries to roll up their own sleeves and contribute to the alongside those who would help them.

### Office Hours

In addition to volunteering in the traditional way, I make my time available free of charge in the form of Office Hours. This allows me to contribute my particular skills to startups and organizations that cannot afford to pay for our capabilities.

## 3. Environmental Conservation

As a guiding principle, we insist on operating in a carbon-neutral way.

### Non-profit and B-Corporation Rates

We offer non-profits and other B Corporations a customary 50% discount off our standard billable rates. This is a steep discount, but it enables us to empower others to use data to have a positive impact, as well.
