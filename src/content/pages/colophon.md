I’m no designer, though I do obsess over typography and colors. Guilty
pleasure. As for the design concepts on this site, many are cribbed from
other people’s sites that I think are awesome.

I think this is ok. Led Zeppelin’s first two albums come straight out of
American blues (mostly Howlin’ Wolf and Willie Dixon, and in many cases,
chord for chord and word for word). For those of you old enough to
remember mix tapes, I actually made a complication that played the
original before the Zep version, one after the other.

The same goes for jazz standards, though jazz musicians tend to be a bit
more explicit about their sources. That’s where I want to land. Steal
liberally and adapt, but give credit.

## Fonts

I previously used [Proxima Nova][] and [Arno Pro][], a noble pair of
Typekit fonts, but Proxima Nova has become so recognizable, I wanted to
switch it out. Recently I read through Matthew Butterick’s [Pratical
Typography][] and really liked what he had to say. I also liked his
fonts, so I have used them on this site.

[Equity][] is his serif offering, and I think it one-ups Garamond, which
says something. I find his italic, in particular, absolutely striking.
I’ve always preferred serif for body text, but only recently have I
fallen out of love with sans serif for headings. Throughout this site, I
stick with 25px fonts or higher where possible, using serif in these
cases.

[Concourse][] is Matthew’s sans serif offering. It’s more geometric than
Proxima, which really stands out in the heavier weights (you could shave
your face using the edge of the capital “N”). But since I’m using sans
serif only below 25px, the thinner weights are more appropriate. I think
it looks very clean.

## Colors

You probably noticed there aren’t a ton of colors around. During the
first wave of flat sites, it was common to see 8 different colors in a
palette with multiple shades of each.

As regular readers will remember, the last version of this site got
caught up in the trend, but every time I saw the site my eyes hurt. It’s
amazing how soon a style will look dated. So, I went back to a cleaner
look with a single blue and shades of grey.

## General design influences

-   You’ll see a *ton* of concepts cribbed from [Paul Jarvis][],
    including using a version of the Bootstrap breadcrumbs for a simple
    nav, sticking with a single accent color paired with shades of grey,
    and keeping it simple on article listings
-   I took the lead from [Thoughtbot][] on the footer and the contact
    page. Directly.
-   [Medium][] for many typographical decisions (mostly having to do
    with what to leave out)
-   [Readability][] for structuring markup for parsing by RSS and their
    own service
-   [Zach Holman’s blog][] for ideas about shades of blue and other
    influences that have gotten squeezed a bit
-   [Mark Strong][] is a design influence of sorts. I imagine him
    reading the blog when I think it’s getting too cute. Usually when
    Mark Strong “looks at the site” I end up taking something
    superfluous out. <small> *Perhaps not often enough.*</small>

## Mechanics and machinery

-   Check out [the source][] on Github, and please help yourself to
    whatever you like.
-   I am now using [Assemble][] rather than Jekyll to generate the
    static site. Since most of my work is in javascript now, it makes
    more sense. Plus, I use ruby for server code, and the static site
    has no server, so there’s that.
-   I have a pretty nasty [Grunt][] workflow you might want to peruse if
    it interests you. Plus [bower][].
-   Coffeescript for js, Less for css, and Handlebars for templates
-   [Bootstrap 3][] as a design framework
-   [Github pages][] for hosting

Please feel free to take any parts of the site that you think would be
useful on yours. No credit necessary, but of course it is nice to let
people know where you get good ideas!
