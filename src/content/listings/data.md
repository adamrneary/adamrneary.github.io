There’s a lot of confusion around data science right now. It’s a term that has picked up tremendous attention, but no one really knows what to hire for and what it all means. For all the hype, many potential clients I’ve worked with are unsure what problems data scientists solve in the first place.

Then, of course, among all the people calling themselves data scientists, there are plenty of things that aren’t taught in Statistics or Computer Science courses. Hopefully some of these articles help fill in the gaps, there, as well.
