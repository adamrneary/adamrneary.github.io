        The new term for guys like me is "Data Scientist," but that title sort
        of means everything and nothing. Whether you're working with massive
        datasets; small, messy, unstructured data; or web applications, the
        point is to solve problems, and that's what I like to do.

        Here are a few representative projects I have tackled over the years. I
        have not included any examples where I wasn't hands on coding, though in
        many cases I was leading teams to whom I owe a tremendous debt of
        gratitude.
