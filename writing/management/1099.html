        <p>Last year I was in a fit when I received a bill from my now former accountants. It would seem when we agreed to do our end of year corporate tax return for a fixed rate of $2,500 they neglected to mention 1099 preparation was not included. It took  2-3 weeks of screwing around with them to get it done, and I was handed a billed for $1,376.56. I thought I was getting punked.</p>
<p>This year, the same activities took around 2 hours and cost me only $87.</p>
<p>This article is less about 1099s and more about how I&#39;ve learned to avoid this type of nightmare as a business owner.</p>
<!-- more -->

<h2 id="yawn-who-cares-">Yawn. Who cares?!</h2>
<p>It is no longer true that you get what you pay for. The world has gotten smaller in a hurry, and there are tons of folks ready to take your money (read, &quot;gouge you&quot;) who don&#39;t want you to know that their very role in the world has changed irreversibly.</p>
<p>As another example, we were told by one service provider that we were getting &quot;a steal&quot; at $5,000 for a 409(a) firm valuation, a costly bureaucratic necessity so that I can issue options to my employees after we raised venture financing. Later, when we were looking into partnering with the same firm, the partner leveled with me that regrettably, he can barely &quot;get away with&quot; charging $5,000 &quot;these days,&quot; apparently forgetting that his printer was still warm from my invoice.</p>
<p>Yet, every once in a while as small business owners we take the cheap route and get royally screwed — and those lessons typically come with an &quot;I told you so&quot; and an even heftier tab, so how&#39;s one to know?</p>
<p>Add to that, these decisions usually have to do with things about which we don&#39;t care at all, like tax preparation, when we have our real jobs to deal with, like building products and helping customers.</p>
<p>Two years in, I feel like I am finally finding my groove, so here are the lessons, and I hope they help you.</p>
<ol>
<li>The real money is in the information gap, so go right to the source</li>
<li>Don&#39;t shop out something you don&#39;t understand</li>
<li>Pay good money for good advice</li>
<li>There&#39;s no substitute for finding service providers and partners you can trust</li>
<li>Outsource and automate everything else</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-real-money-is-in-the-information-gap-so-go-right-to-the-source">The real money is in the information gap, so go right to the source</h2>
<p>1099s are tax forms you fill out for contractors and service providers that let the government know how much they earned, just as W2s do for internal employees. Great news: You don&#39;t have to worry about low value (less than $600/year) vendors, and you don&#39;t have to worry about corporations (which in theory should be more reliable in terms of reporting their revenue).</p>
<p>In short, W2s and 1099s exist to ensure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are correctly reporting your expenses. If you didn&#39;t have to report your contractors, you could potentially pay all employees under the table and not have to pay taxes, which is dishonest and profoundly un-American. Seriously.</li>
<li>Your contractors are reporting their income. If no one told the government that &quot;Derek&quot; made $250,000 in web design revenue last year, could we really count on Derek to be honest about his income and pay his share like a traditional employee would automatically?</li>
</ol>
<p>So that&#39;s what 1099s are, and to find out about the specific rules, I have found most online resources (including this post) to fall short on the details. But of all places, if you google &quot;1099 instructions&quot; you&#39;ll get a PDF from the IRS that lays everything out quite clearly, actually.</p>
<p>Going right to the source prevents what happened to me last year, which was an expensive accountant trying to make the process sound as complicated as possible so they could charge as much as possible.</p>
<p>Put simply, people that know things can charge a lot of money to people that don&#39;t. Get educated and avoid getting taken advantage of.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-shop-out-something-you-don-t-understand">Don&#39;t shop out something you don&#39;t understand</h2>
<p>I know, I know. You don&#39;t have time to learn up on everything in the world. That&#39;s what you pay your trusted advisors for, right?! I assure you, I&#39;m busy, too. The reality is, a <strong>cursory understanding of the key decision points</strong> around Finance, Tax, Accounting, HR, ruby on rails, javascript, html/css, semi-conductors, nuclear physics, pediatrics, personal investing, dating…can be acquired in a short period of time. You don&#39;t have to become an expert in all things in order to survive in this world, but if you don&#39;t know enough about a thing to discuss the key decision points in an informed way:</p>
<ol>
<li>You don&#39;t know enough to assess whether someone else can</li>
<li>You don&#39;t know enough to assess whether it&#39;s been done correctly</li>
<li>You don&#39;t know enough to assess whether you&#39;re getting taken advantage of</li>
</ol>
<p>When we outsource development (something done <strong>very</strong> rarely at Profitably because we&#39;re so young and know so little), we only shop out components that we could write ourselves…and only if we feel like we have time to explain what we need clearly…and only if we know how we would assess quality.</p>
<p>Early on we did try, several times, bringing in experts to complement our skills and build out components we would have been slow to build ourselves. Suffice it to say, 100% of those vendors&#39; bills are paid, and 100% of that code has been thrown out. (Queue the &#39;sad trombone&#39; sound effect or the sound they play when someone loses Plinko.)</p>
<h2 id="pay-good-money-for-good-advice">Pay good money for good advice</h2>
<p>If the real money is in the information gap, having partners that can help point you in the right direction is your best offense. This advice is worth a tremendous amount of money and time, so don&#39;t get cheap if you need to understand something and don&#39;t.</p>
<p>Ignorance is more expensive, and one of the most important skills I&#39;ve learned over the last couple years is how to ask a <em>ton</em> of short, simple, and unequivocal questions in a non-threatening way. If you&#39;re not combative about something but the person you&#39;re talking to is getting defensive, it&#39;s time to talk to someone else. And to that…</p>
<h2 id="there-s-no-substitute-for-finding-service-providers-and-partners-you-can-trust">There&#39;s no substitute for finding service providers and partners you can trust</h2>
<p>We still have our first attorneys, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, and we were very lucky to find such a reliable partner the first time around and so early in our company&#39;s life.</p>
<p>We had tragic experiences with our first accountants (an experience far worse than I would comfortably put in writing) and our first HR provider. But now we&#39;re up and running with EisnerAmper and Insperity, and I have nothing but good things to say about both.</p>
<p>One of the most consistent trait across these partners — and I say partners rather than vendors because they&#39;ve earned it — is that I get sound advice from them, and I am comfortable that they are looking to make money when they provide sound advice, even if it&#39;s, &quot;Check out this online resource that explains xyz.&quot;</p>
<p>WSGR charges me Partner time for only the most critical of activities (and usually writes off most of that!), charges me Associate time for the bulk of the &quot;doing,&quot; and charges me paralegal time for paralegal work. They use templates for most standard docs, they don&#39;t deviate from standard docs unnecessarily, and they even post a staggering amount of valuable information about term sheets for financings online…for free.</p>
<p>What seems obvious is accurately quite rare, and you shouldn&#39;t accept anything less from your partners.</p>
<h2 id="outsource-and-automate-everything-else">Outsource and automate everything else</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s the light at the end of the tunnel. Once you&#39;ve gone through the process of understanding something like the 1099 process, ride that knowledge like a pony and make it yours.</p>
<p>Last year, the process was grueling, distracting, and expensive.</p>
<p>This year, the process was easy. I went to <a href="https://track1099.com/">track1099.com</a> and found an easy service provider who would process the busy work and postage-related nonsense around the 1099 process for next to nothing. They&#39;re IRS approved, and they partner with providers like <a href="http://www.bill.com/">bill.com</a>, whom I know, so that&#39;s good enough for me (perhaps I&#39;m in a unique situation — if I get screwed by track1099.com I am calling our friends at bill.com straight away!).</p>
<p>The whole process took a couple hours:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a report in QuickBooks to pull 2011 total expense by vendor</li>
<li>Drop the results in Excel sorted by total amount, kill off everyone under $600, and snipe out the corporations manually</li>
<li>Go back to QuickBooks to see compare the new list of 1099 vendors with the old list from last year (there were 7-8 I had to add)</li>
<li>Run a vendor contact list in QuickBooks, filtered to active 1099 vendors, and pull all the info required for the 1099 form, including tax id (I was missing 3 tax IDs, so I emailed my contacts at those three companies)</li>
<li>Download the CSV template from track1099.com, copy over your output from QuickBooks, and upload everything (there were a couple items I needed to review and those last tax IDs to add in)…</li>
<li>Submit your 1099s a fleeting several hours after you got started</li>
</ol>
<aside>
  <em>Brief aside:</em> Right now, the crew at track1099.com is on the hook for printing the resulting info properly on the machine-readable triplicate forms, sending the proper copies to the federal government and to all my contractors and partners. I can track the results worry free.
</aside>

<p>Last year&#39;s 3 week boondoggle and unexpected $1,376.56 punch in the mouth became a two hour stress-free task costing me $87. And I have a pdf output of everything already stored away for next year as opposed to a giant snail mail package to look for in two weeks (that I won&#39;t be able to find next year).</p>
<p>Shopping out the non-core is the way of the future, and it&#39;s…well…awesome. But learning how to get it right takes time and a level of precision. I certainly hope you get there soon, because it&#39;s nicer over here.</p>
