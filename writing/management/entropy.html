        <p>Two of the most fascinating books I have read lately are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi/dp/0061339202"><em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Practicing-Guide-Making-Music/dp/0609801775/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357225684&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+practicing"><em>The Art of Practicing</em> by Madeline Bruser</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Flow</em> discusses, among other things, the concept of psychic entropy, which could loosely be described as distractions but actually which drives much deeper as a force to disrupt focus and attention.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>The absence of this entropy is the &quot;flow&quot; state where concentration remains uninterrupted, and not only does more and better work get done, but his science indicates leads to a richer, happier, and more full life experience.</p>
<p>The presence of this entropy is a frustrating and unproductive situation I encounter all too often. Food chewing noises and salesperson phone calls, obnoxiously loud headphones in the subway, car horns honking, jerks driving erratically in Hoboken…all these things interrupt a natural thought process as I seek to unwind simple math problems, chart a course for my company, or plan out events with my family.</p>
<p>As Csikszentmihalyi concludes, the very act of maintaining a focused &quot;flow&quot; state can generate outsized returns in terms of enjoyment and calm, even or especially when doing work.</p>
<p><em>The Art of Practicing</em>, in a somewhat similar vein, discusses the way that professional musicians are able to turn routine, grueling, miserable &quot;practice&quot; into their most enjoyable task. It isn&#39;t by simply deciding to enjoy the toil, but — a la Sisyphus — translate the challenge into the journey in a calm and energetic way.</p>
<p>In this way, the frustrating, monotonous, and overly strenuous labor becomes an exhilarating and rewarding experience, and it is all linked to posture, breathing, focus, and attention.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that the term &quot;practice&quot; is applied to learning piano, but also to yoga. You &quot;practice&quot; yoga, after all. Sure, my second favorite thing about yoga is losing weight and gaining flexibility. But my favorite part is the practice itself. It is a 90 minute meditation in which no one but the instructor is allowed to speak (thank heavens for such a blessed window!), and in that time, while performing the various asanas (poses), you can do one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can let your mind run wild, reviewing and processing all the outstanding mental to-dos in the queue</li>
<li>You can train your mind to &quot;let go&quot; of its internal monologue and focus on breathing</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, the latter is the approach prescribed by the instructor, but as the to-do queue gets longer and longer, it&#39;s amazing how difficult that can be.</p>
<p>And yet, I find what they say to be entirely true. If I relax and &quot;let go&quot; of my internal thought process (rather than forcefully trying to shut it down or strangle it, which never works), I can focus on my breath, and I can sense my heart rate slow down. In this yoga flow state, I can do all the postures, and the otherwise exhausting routine is almost annoyingly energizing.</p>
<p>But then the thoughts creep in. 90 minutes is a long time.</p>
<p>I start to think about what I have to get done in the evening. My heart rate elevates slightly. Wouldn&#39;t a burrito be a nice dinner? After a solid workout like this, I can cheat and have sour cream. Shit! Why am I hungry all of a sudden?! I am really concerned about the decline in so-and-so&#39;s work. How are we going to get him back to delivering great work again? I check in on my respiratory rate, and it&#39;s way up. My heart rate is elevating. I start to get dizzy in the pose, the posture of which has declined noticeably. I try to correct the posture but overcompensate and fall out of it entirely. Sweat is pouring, but now I notice it. Dizzier still, I sit down. Flow disrupted. Entropy wins.</p>
<p>The same battle is waged at work just the same. Right now, in fact, there is a dog right outside my office running up and down the hall, and I can see it through the glass walls. It is incredibly distracting for me, and just as I am about to reach my own flow state, that dog runs past, nails on its paws against the hardwood floors erratic and noisy, shaking me out of my concentration. My first thought is to speak with the dog owner about keeping his pet at bay during prime working hours (please). But I know that this is a short term solution.</p>
<p>The real solution is to <strong>practice</strong> not minding, to cultivate my attention, to turn my work into a series of 1-2 hour meditations, and to train my mind in a calm way to perceive the dog without allowing the dog to capture my attention and disrupt my flow state.</p>
<p>It is difficult but rewarding, just like yoga. And it is for the same reasons that I taking up piano practice again. With a startup to run, a 15 month old son at home, and a baby on the way, I don&#39;t think I have ever been busier, but it is striking how a simple, focused 20-minute practice involving nothing beyond arpeggios and a metronome can leave you with a better-ordered conscious capable of much greater focus of attention.</p>
<p>As a parting thought, I have often rolled my eyes at lazy people who claim that only working <em>x</em> hours per week is smart because there are diminishing returns on additional hours per week. They spend their other free cycles playing video games and hanging out, and more power to them, but they aren&#39;t actually maximizing their working hours; they just have fewer of them. And sometimes I count myself one of them!</p>
<p>But when you take time out to cultivate focus and train your attention, you sacrifice some working hours, but those hours really do become materially more productive. We shouldn&#39;t lump both situations together and plan on 30 hour work weeks for all, but we should explore the impact psychic entropy has on our work and our lives, and we should make time to practice whatever it is that cultivates our attention.</p>
