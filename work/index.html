                <em>Data Science</em> is the new term for the work I have been
                doing for over a decade. Sometimes it involves massive, homogenous
                datasets, but more often it involves many dirty, disparate
                datasets that require cleansing and blending, categorization and
                normalization, and more than a little domain expertise to
                contextualize.

              <p>
                From there analytics is all about problem solving, finding ways

                ambiguous questions.

                At the outset of software application design, speed is the name
                of the game. A working, clickable prototype of an app is worth
                a thousand whiteboard drawings or a hundred wireframes.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you see the app first hand, even without intricate visual
                design, you know what needs changing and can iterate quickly. I
                try to deliver the first version of the application within the
                first week so that the iteration process can begin.
              </p>

                Once the prototype is complete and signed off, back end engineers
                having working html templates and css to build against, and visual
                designers and front end engineers have a clean, clear application
                to build against with no UX ambiguity.

                  Software applications are notoriously hard to describe and
